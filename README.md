## Linux on the Lenovo ThinkPad T430

Various configs, scripts, and workarounds I use.


Things to add for `sway` branch:
- `~/.config/sway/config`
- `~/bin/swaystat` (and fonts)
- `~/bin/startsway`
- brightness trickery
- power issues
- custom builds (wlc, X, etc.)


_add `.vim/` and `.bash/` stuff that people will hate :)_
